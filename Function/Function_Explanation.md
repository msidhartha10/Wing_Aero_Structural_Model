# ðŸ“– Detailed Explanation

This project is built as a modular MATLAB pipeline for finite wing aerodynamic and structural analysis.  
Below is a breakdown of what each part of the workflow does.

---

### **Overview**

This MATLAB script models the aerodynamics, loads, structural response, and performance of a finite wing based on 2D airfoil data. It pulls in airfoil coefficients, applies finite-wing corrections, estimates lift distributions, calculates shear/bending diagrams, deflections, and finally predicts aircraft range/endurance using Breguet equations.

The workflow is modular â€” each major step calls a custom function, which keeps the code organized.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **1. Inputs**

* **Atmospheric data:** air density, freestream velocity, viscosity, gravity.
* **Wing geometry:** root chord, tip chord, half-span.
* **Aerodynamic data:** imported from an Excel file with 2D coefficients (`Aero_Coeff_2D.xlsx`).
* **Angles of attack:** user sets a sweep (`-4Â° to 10Â°`) and picks a working AOA for analysis.
* **Discretization:** number of spanwise sections for lift/pressure distribution.

---

#### **2. Wing Parameter Calculation**

Function: `Wing_Parameter_Calculation`  
Computes key geometry and flow quantities:

* Span, area, aspect ratio, taper ratio.
* Mean aerodynamic chord (MAC).
* Reynolds number.
* Dynamic pressure.
* Oswald efficiency factor (e).

These parameters are the backbone for 3D lift/drag predictions.

---

#### **3. Aerodynamic Coefficients (3D corrections)**

Function: `aerodynamic_coeff`

* Converts 2D airfoil data into **finite wing CL and CD** using lifting-line theory and induced drag correction.
* Outputs:
  * 3D lift curve slope.
  * Zero-lift angle.
  * Drag polar with induced drag.
  * Lift-to-drag ratio across AOA sweep.

Plots show the aerodynamic behavior of the wing vs. angle of attack.

#### **4. Schrenkâ€™s Lift Distribution**

Function: `schrenk_dist`

* Approximates spanwise lift distribution using Schrenkâ€™s method (average of planform and elliptical distribution).
* Computes:
  * Chord distribution (planform, elliptical, Schrenk).
  * Spanwise lift per unit length for each case.

This is useful for preliminary load analysis when CFD or wind tunnel data isnâ€™t available.

---

#### **5. Sectional Lift & Pressure**

Function: `sec_lift_pressure`

* Divides the span into discrete sections (trapezoidal strips).
* Calculates:
  * Section lift.
  * Pressure distribution along span.

Gives a breakdown of how lift is shared across the wing.

---

#### **6. Intra-section Pressure Distribution**

Function: `over_the_section`

* Zooms into each sectionâ€™s surface.
* Estimates **spanwise + chordwise lift and pressure variation**.
* Helps visualize aerodynamic loading at a finer scale.

---

#### **7. Shear Force & Bending Moment (SFD & BMD)**

Functions: `SFD_BMD` / `SFD_BMD2`

* From lift distribution, computes:
  * Shear force diagram (SFD).
  * Bending moment diagram (BMD).
* Adds point loads (masses mounted along span).
* Outputs **root shear** and **root bending moment**, plus distributed vs. concentrated loads.

This bridges aerodynamics with structural loads.

---

#### **8. Wing Deflection**

Function: `Deflection`

* Uses bending moment distribution + material stiffness (E, I).
* Solves beam deflection along span.
* Outputs:
  * Deflection shape.
  * Tip deflection.
  * Slope (theta).

Lets you test materials (carbon fiber vs. foam) and see stiffness effects.

---

#### **9. Range & Endurance (Breguet)**

Function: `Range_Endurance`

* Applies **Breguet equations** for prop aircraft.
* Inputs:
  * Efficiency, SFC, L/D ratio, weights.
* Outputs:
  * Range.
  * Endurance.

Connects the wing-level aerodynamics back to whole-aircraft mission performance.

---

### **Outputs You Get**

* Tables of 3D lift/drag at different AOAs.
* Lift/pressure distribution across sections.
* SFD/BMD values + reaction loads.
* Maximum wing deflection.
* Propeller aircraft range & endurance.

And plenty of optional plots (commented in the script).

### **NOTE-**

This MATLAB project models the aerodynamic and structural behavior of a finite wing using classical methods. Starting from 2D airfoil data, it applies finite-wing corrections, estimates lift distributions (Schrenkâ€™s method), calculates shear and bending diagrams, evaluates structural deflection, and predicts aircraft performance (range and endurance) using Breguet equations. The workflow is modular, with each step implemented as a separate function, making it easy to adapt for different wing geometries, materials, or flight conditions.
